# Data Analyst Capstone Project - Invest INC. Cryptocurrency Portfolio Optimization

## Project Overview

This data analyst capstone project is part of the "Google Data Analyst Professional Certificate" online course. The project focuses on a hypothetical company, Invest INC., which manages a crypto investment portfolio. The company has historical data for three different cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin, and Ravencoin. The primary goal of this project is to optimize the allocation of these cryptocurrencies within the company's portfolio.

## Project Details

### Hypothetical Company: Invest INC.

Invest INC. is a small-scale investment firm specializing in cryptocurrencies. The company manages a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio and aims to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of assets among Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ravencoin. The historical data for these cryptocurrencies is available for analysis.

### Problem Statement

Invest INC. seeks data-driven insights to optimize its cryptocurrency portfolio. The company wants to answer the following questions:

- What is the historical performance of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ravencoin?
- How have the prices and returns of these cryptocurrencies fluctuated over time?
- Based on historical data, which cryptocurrency should form the core of the portfolio, and what should be the allocation percentages for each coin?

### Data Sources

The dataset contains historical prices, trading volumes, and other relevant information for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ravencoin. It provides the necessary data points to evaluate the performance of these cryptocurrencies.

### Methodology

The analysis will be conducted using data manipulation and visualization techniques. Key steps in the project include:

1. **Ask:** The initial phase involves formulating essential questions and understanding the problem's context. Effective communication with stakeholders ensures a comprehensive understanding.
2. **Prepare:** The second phase focuses on data collection and organization, including metric identification and data source assessment.
3. **Process:** Data cleaning and refinement are addressed in the third phase to maintain data integrity.
4. **Analyze:** The analysis phase explores data to uncover relationships, trends, and patterns to enhance decision-making.
5. **Share:** Findings are communicated effectively using visualization techniques to facilitate understanding.
6. **Act:** The final phase involves acting on insights and providing actionable recommendations to address business challenges.

Adherence to these structured phases ensures an effective and methodical approach to data-driven decision-making.

### Project Outputs

- Historical performance trends for BTC, Dogecoin, and Ravencoin.
- An optimized cryptocurrency portfolio allocation strategy for Invest INC.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `data`: Contains the historical cryptocurrency data.
- `notebooks`: Includes Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis.
- `visualizations & Dashboard`: Contains visual representations of the data.
- `results`: Contains the final recommendations and insights.

## Dependencies

This project relies on MySQL for data storage and table joints,
R, Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization, and Tableau for dashboard visualization.

Most analysis were done using python `[Because I am more familiar with it]` and same was done using R because it was used during the classes.
